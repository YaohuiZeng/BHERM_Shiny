# BHERM_Shiny

Bayesian Hierarchical Exposure Response Model (BHERM) + Shiny front-end app

## Description

This is one of two projects I completed at [Novartis Oncology](https://www.novartisoncology.com/) for my 2016 summer internship. As a result, I developed an (internally used) R package, namely BHERM, and an Shiny front-end app for conducting Bayesian Exposure-Response (ER) analysis.

This repository is just for demonstration purpose. Due to copyright issue, the (main) code files of the package and shiny app are not open sourced here. So the shiny app is not running properly. But one can still run ```server.R or ui.R``` to take a look at the layout.

1. The **BHERM-manual.pdf** is the manual of the R package BHERM.
2. [server.R](https://github.com/YaohuiZeng/BHERM_Shiny/blob/master/server.R) and [ui.R](https://github.com/YaohuiZeng/BHERM_Shiny/blob/master/ui.R) are the R files for the shiny GUI.
3. The two ```BHERM_shiny.png``` file is a screenshot of the Shiny app.
