# BHERM_Shiny

Bayesian Hierarchical Exposure Response Model (BHERM) + Shiny front-end app

### Description

This is one of two projects I completed at [Novartis Oncology](https://www.novartisoncology.com/) for my 2016 summer internship. As a result, I developed an (internal used) R package, namely BHERM, and an Shiny front-end app for conducting Bayesian Exposure-Response (ER) analysis.
